## 📌 Project Overview

DriverPass is a cloud-based system designed to help students prepare for the DMV driving test. The platform enables students to register for driving packages, schedule lessons, take online practice tests, and track their progress. The system also supports role-based access for admins, instructors, and students, replacing a fragmented manual process with a scalable, secure, and centralized solution.

## 📝 Journal Reflection

### Project Summary
The client, **Liam**, owner of DriverPass driving instruction company, requested a cloud-based platform to automate student registration, scheduling, testing, and progress tracking.

### Successes
- Clearly translated user interviews and client needs into structured business and functional requirements.
- Delivered documentation with a focus on scalability, security, and usability.

### Improvements
The lesson and package management feature could be enhanced by allowing staff to edit package details via a low-code interface instead of developer intervention.

### User Needs Integration
Functional requirements such as calendar integration, email notifications, progress dashboards, and audit logs were derived from interview analysis, ensuring the system solves real user challenges.

### Design Approach
I use user-centered analysis, modular architecture, and maintainability principles — incorporating use case diagrams, class diagrams, wireframes, and requirement traceability matrices. Future projects will expand agile prototyping and CI/CD integration.
