## 📝 Journal Reflection 

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

The DriverPass project was initiated by a client named **Liam**, the owner of a driving instruction company called DriverPass. He envisioned a cloud-based platform where students could register for driving packages, schedule lessons, take online practice tests, and track their progress. The goal was to replace the existing manual, fragmented system with a centralized solution that supports automation, data tracking, and role-based access for staff and students. 

--- 

### What did you do particularly well? 

I did particularly well in clearly translating user interviews and client needs into a set of **structured business and functional requirements**. My documentation outlined both the technical architecture and user-facing interactions. I also ensured the solution was **scalable, secure, and user-friendly**, focusing on both immediate goals and long-term flexibility. 

--- 

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I would revise the **lesson and package management feature**. While the current system allows packages to be activated or deactivated, it would be more user-friendly if staff could modify package details (e.g., hours or materials) without developer involvement. I would improve it by introducing a low-code interface in future iterations, allowing business users more control over offerings. 

--- 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing the **interview transcript** and identifying key challenges like scheduling, communication, and reporting. These were translated into **functional requirements** such as calendar integration, email notifications, progress dashboards, and audit logs. Considering the user’s needs is critical—it ensures the solution is **actually usable, solves the right problems,** and increases the likelihood of adoption.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

I approach software design with a focus on **user-centered analysis, modular architecture, and maintainability**. I typically use: 
- **Use case diagrams** 
- **Class and activity diagrams** 
- **Wireframes or mockups** 
- **Requirement traceability matrices** 

In future projects, I would expand my use of **agile prototyping** and introduce **user story mapping** early on, followed by continuous feedback loops and integration with MLOps or CI/CD tools for scalable deployment.
